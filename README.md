# TOTLEN

This is a work in progress code.  I am learning C# through the creation of custom commadns for AutoCAD.  
I am having some issues with this, and wanted to opn this up for some helpful input! If you comment, 
remember I am a beginner in C# and There are likely better ways to accomplish what I am trying to 
accomplish.  

This command is designed to provide the user with the total length of selected objects in a drawing.  
It should work using a pick-first set (picked before command is run), or a selection set after the 
commadn is run.  It should be able to handle Polylines, Lines, and Arcs (seems to be easier said 
than done).  I appreciate any help, and thanks in advance!
