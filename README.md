# TOTLEN

This is a work in progress code.  I am learning C# through the creation of custom commadns for AutoCAD.  
I am having some issues with this, and wanted to open this up for some helpful input! If you comment, 
remember I am a beginner in C# and There are likely better ways to accomplish what I am trying to 
accomplish.  

This command is designed to provide the user with the total length of selected objects in a drawing.  
As a start, I would like to clear any selection and ask the user to pick objects after running the 
command.  In the future it may be nice to work with the pickfirst set.  As of now, the sum methods 
calculate the correct lengths of the given objects, but there is a disconnect between the methods
and printing the result in the editor.  Thanks in advance for any help!
