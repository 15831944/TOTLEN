# TOTLEN

This is my first custom command in AutoCAD.  This command uses a pcikfirst set (if it's selected) of 
lines, arcs, and polylines to provide the user a sum of length for all selected objects.  This code 
works well and has been mildly tested throughout our office.  FEel free to suggest input on how to 
update or edit the comand, and if you find it helpful, let me know! Cheers!
